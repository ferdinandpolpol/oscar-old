This document is for automated checkouts for the purpose of daily builds. (We will use the myoscar_server project as an example here.)

Install prerequisites like Java, Tomcat, Maven, MySql.

Install the server once like a normal deployment with database configured and everything and all working.

Then... the following is to automate redeployment :

0) make sure you setup a good working directory like ~/myoscar/git
1) manually clone a repository : git clone git://192.168.1.241/myoscar_server

2) make need a cron job that
	a) fetches updates from source code repository
	b) clean compiles (including cleaning maven repo ~/.m2/repository)
	c) resets the database
	d) if build succeeds deploy to tomcat
	
There's a sample script automated_deploy.sh which can be used as a template for what to do.	

There's a sample script automated_deploy_cron_logger.sh which is a wrapper which helps log what the cron is doing. It requires the cron_logs directory as per the script contents.
